      question: "What is Resume Builder?",
      answer: "A resume builder is an app or software program anyone can use to quickly and easily make resumes, cover letters and CVs. Many sites, including , offer a resume builder service to help you through every resume section, offering tips and guidance along the way. Builders automate parts of the resume-writing process using AI to generate text suggestions based on your work experience.

    {
      question: "Do I need a different resume for every Job Application?",
      answer: "Yes! The best way to get your resume through an ATS is to customize it for every role you apply to.Study the job description to understand which skills are critical to that specific role and then update your resume accordingly, focusing on the professional summary or resume objective, the skills section and the bullet points in your work experience section. Customizing your resume doesn’t take long and can help set you apart from the competition, helping you land an interview."
    },
    {
      question: "How many jobs should you put on a resume?",
      answer: "You can add as many previous jobs to your resume as you’d like as long as they’re relevant to the target job and fit in one to two pages. A good rule of thumb is you should only go back about 10-15 years because your earlier experience may be out of date. For most job seekers, that amounts to including somewhere between three and seven jobs, but the exact number will differ depending on the person. By the way, if you’ve held many jobs, you should definitely use a chronological or a combination resume format. They both emphasize work history."
    },
    {
      question: "How long should my Resume be?",
      answer: "A resume should be no longer than two pages. If you’re new to the workforce or have only worked for a few years, the resume length shouldn’t exceed one page. A good rule of thumb is to write one page for every decade of experience you possess and to keep your document focused on the last 20 years of your professional experience. If you need more than two pages, you may want to look into writing a curriculum vitae (CV) instead."
    },
    {
      question: "Do Employers prefer Word or PDF resume?",
      answer: "While some employers accept both file formats, you may find PDF is the preferred type. Why? PDFs are better at retaining formatting. This makes it easier for the employer to open the file without worrying about issues like font style and bullet points.Ultimately, you’ll want to submit whichever file type the employer requests, so read the job listing closely. Either format can be downloaded from our Resume Builder."
    },
    {
      question: "What is a CPRW?",
      answer: "CPRW stands for Certified Professional Resume Writer. The CPRW credential is awarded by the Professional Association of Resume Writers & Career Coaches (PARWCC) to those who have passed a rigorous resume-writing exam. This credential is the global industry standard for professional resume writers and shows that the individual with the credential possesses the highest level of resume-writing knowledge and a commitment to excellence in the field."
